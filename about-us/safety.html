   The construction business is now and in many ways, has always been dangerous. At Meyer Brothers Building Company, we believe that it is possible to control, if not eliminate most accidents.
  </p>
  <p>
   By controlling our actions and attitudes we can have a serious effect on the security of individual jobs and the well-being of all employees. People are our most valuable asset. We intend to guard lives with more energy than we devote to guarding our reputation, our property and profitability.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is the policy of Meyer Brothers Building Company that the safety of our employees is considered a vital aspect of our operations.
