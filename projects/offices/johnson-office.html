   maximizing space and cutting the cost
  </h1>
  <p>
   <em>
    Modern technology and conventional material unite to conquer space management and budget conflicts.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   Johnson Controls needed a single story office building that would utilize space and cut costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   We delivered a single story structure utilizing cast-on-site tilt-up wall panels with a conventional steel framing system.
  </p>
  <p>
   To bring a maximum seal and prevent leaking, we constructed a four-ply built-up roof.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Design/Build team for this build-to-suit project consisted of the owner, architect, Johnson Controls management, and Meyer Brothers Building Company.
