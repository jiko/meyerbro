   A Creative atmosphere for design
  </h1>
  <p>
   Meyer Brothers Building Co. served as general contractor for this Class A office building in Lee's Summit, MO.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Exchange facility is a three-story office buiding using site-cast tilt-up load bearing concrete wall systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   A variety of exterior finishes were used on this project to make it stand out among the other offices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Exterior finishes include masonry bands, tilt-up screen walls, exposed aggregate, cast-in-plae thin brick and a chameleon wall system.
  </p>
  <p>
   The interior of this multi-tenant building has common area restrooms, showers, and an exercise facility.
