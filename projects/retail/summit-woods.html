   building effeciencies = earlier occupation
  </h1>
  <p>
   Despite severe winter weather, tilt-up construction allowed retailers to achieve earlier occupancy.
  </p>
  <p>
   With only 10 months to build a 260,000 square-foot facility that includes a host of national retailers, achieving an aggressive schedule was paramount for the entire building team.
  </p>
  <p>
   By selecting site-cast tilt-up construction over precast, the project was completed 10-15 percent faster.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since this facility is highly visible in the community, great attention was placed on cosmetic appeal. The variety of finishes also allowed each retailer to create a unique image.
