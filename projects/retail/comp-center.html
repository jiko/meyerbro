   tailored to meet your needs
  </h1>
  <p>
   Batis Development worked with Davidson Design Group and Meyer Brothers Building Company to build this 10,000 sq. ft. retail strip center on a site in front of Comp USA in Eastland Center.
  </p>
  <p>
   The building is composed of cast-on-site load bearing tilt-up concrete wall panels with a conventional structural steel
        framing system.
  </p>
  <p>
   Several of the panels have cosmetic rustication lines and additional cosmetic masonry applications.
