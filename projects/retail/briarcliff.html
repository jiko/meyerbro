   Merging office and retail
  </h1>
  <p>
   The use of tilt-up concrete wall panels consisting of extremely high-end architectural site-cast concrete offers strength and flexibility in developing an open air medium where offices and retail may integrate.
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
   Two-story load bearing panels allow for the topographical differences for multi-level entries.
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
   The building consists of a system of conventional structural steel. The exterior is dressed in brick, stone, EIFS and glass to welcome the light.
