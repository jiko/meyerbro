  <p>
   Meyer Brothers Building Company performs at many levels, incorporating the best work ethic and attitude when working with others.
  </p>
  <p>
   At Olathe Pointe, Meyer Brothers provided the foundation, slab-on-grade, site-cast tilt-up wall panels, structural steel, structural design, and furnishing materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of the “shell package,” Meyer Brothers worked with Con/Steel Tilt-up Systems for the structural design component and our crews self-performed the other phases of concrete work.
