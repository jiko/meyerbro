   “The tilt-up process saved a great deal of time.” - Owners
  </p>
  <p>
   Meyer Brothers Building Company was contacted by Old Navy 
        to build their retail facility in the Zona Rosa development in
        Kansas City, MO.
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
   The building was constructed using
        site-cast concrete. The outside is complimented
        with cast-in stone, direct
        applied synthetic stucco, foam stucco
        cornices, and water tables.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pilasters highlight this structure and
        bring a modern elegance for customers
        to enjoy.
