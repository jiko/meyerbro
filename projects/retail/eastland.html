   structured for a secure investment
  </h1>
  <p>
   North Star Bank was built using cast-on-site load bearing tilt-up concrete wall panels. The use of tilt-up concrete provided a quicker build time than when using conventional load-bearing materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   To add to the strength and security of the building, a conventional structural steel framing system fills the infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
   To bring an appearance of excellence to match the reputation, thin brick facing and additional cosmetic masonry were applied to the facade.
