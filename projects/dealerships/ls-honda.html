   This one-story facility was designed in a collaborative effort with the Honda 2000 Dealership Image Program. The program was designed to bring a cohesive look to the dealerships and Meyer Brothers Building Company served as the general contractor.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meyer Brothers Building worked with the program and integrated our cast-on-site concrete wall panel trademark.
  </p>
  <p>
   The framing system is composed of steel and a glass curtain wall encloses the showroom area.
  </p>
  <p>
   The building showcases office space, a showroom floor, and a service area.
