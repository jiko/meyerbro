   Powell Gardens Heartland Harvest Gardens Exhibition Building and Silo
  </p>
  <h2>
   “Site-Cast” tilt-up concrete for creative project solutions
  </h2>
  <p>
   Cutting edge construction methods were used to replicate a structure from the past.  Site cast concrete pieces were constructed in rings to replicate an original silo.
  </p>
  <p>
   The silo was constructed in rings and each ring was made up of 3 pieces.  The silo is 22 ft. in diameter and  40 ft. tall.
  </p>
  <p>
   For accessibility an elevator tower was constructed out of tilt-up concrete.  All four sides of the elevator shaft were stack cast on top of one another.
  </p>
  <h2>
   no limits to our decorative work
  </h2>
  <p>
   For the Heartland Harvest Gardens project we constructed nearly 1 mile of 10 ft. wide decorative concrete sidewalk.   Not only was this concrete colored and stamped, but we also inserted leaf imprints on the borders.
  </p>
  <p>
   We did an extensive mock-up process using several different colors and stamping methods for both the general stamping and the leaf imprints.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Ultimate use of Sustainable Products
  </h2>
  <p>
   We used real leaves harvested from the trees at Powell Gardens for the leaf imprints.  In all we used over 12 species of tree and plant leaves.
  </p>
  <p>
   The leaves were soaked in water for pliability and then hand laid and worked into the concrete surface.  Upon cure the leaves were then removed and lightly washed for a perfect leaf imprint.
