   raising the bar in excellence

  <p>
   Our building techniques provide stronger structures that protect your investement and your future.
  </p>
  <p>
   Every building needs to have a strong structure. In this single-story structure we utilized a conventional structural steel
        framing system with cast-on-site tilt-up load bearing wall panels.
  </p>
  <p>
   The office roof is a single story structure using a pre-engineered metal building system provided by Butler Manufacturing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The exterior wall system is full height metal panels with an interior liner panel.
  </p>
  <p>
   The roof is a MR-24 standing seam panel with a galvelume finish.
