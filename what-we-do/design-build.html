   The Design/Build process pulls together building owner, architect, general contractor and any specialty subcontractors into a cohesive team with either the general contractor or architect serving as the team leader with overall responsibility for project communication.
   <p>
    Meyer Brothers frequently serves as that point person but we are also team players when the architect takes the lead.
    <p>
     Because of the design/build structure, costs are minimized and time is saved because all parties have accepted the project's design before construction starts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Simply put, this up-front agreement leads to less confusion during the execution of the contract. This single source responsibility creates more opportunities for value engineering.
